# Anti-Churn Multi-Agent System

A simplified, interactive multi-agent system for customer success management and churn prevention, built with OpenAI Agent framework and MCP servers.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT DATA DISCLAIMER**

**This system uses ONLY publicly available, non-confidential data for demonstration purposes.**

- **Customer Data**: All customer data (ACME001, FIN001, TECH002) is **synthetic/demo data** - no real customer information is used
- **Appier Information**: Only publicly available information about Appier Marketing Solution products and services
- **No Confidential Data**: No proprietary, confidential, or sensitive business data is included in this system
- **Demo Purpose Only**: This is a proof-of-concept MVP for demonstrating multi-agent architecture capabilities

**For production deployment, real customer data integration would require proper data security, privacy compliance, and enterprise-grade security measures.**

## üåç Real-World Deployment Considerations

This MVP demonstrates the core multi-agent architecture, but real-world deployment would require additional components:

### Autonomous Monitoring Capabilities
- **Periodic Client Monitoring** - Agents autonomously monitor client activity across:
  - Campaign usage patterns and performance
  - Support ticket analysis (Jira integration)
  - Product adoption metrics and feature usage
  - Customer engagement indicators
- **Proactive Alerting** - Automated notifications when churn risk increases on internal messenger tools or emails

### Enterprise Integration
- **Communication Tools** - Integration with:
  - Email servers for automated notifications
  - Internal communication platforms (Slack, MS Teams)
  - CRM systems for customer data synchronization (salesforce, etc)
- **Workflow Automation** - Direct engagement with customer success tools

### Advanced Agent Architecture
- **Customer-Facing Agents** - Direct customer interaction for churn prevention
- **Model Diversification** - Specialized models for different agentic tasks
- **RAG Enhancement** - Retrieval-Augmented Generation for better context awareness

## üîÆ Future Enhancement possibility

- **CRM Integration** - Connect to real CRM systems
- **Real-time Data** - Live data feeds instead of CSV files (data engineering and processing required)
- **Advanced Analytics** - Machine learning for churn prediction
- **Automated Actions** - Direct integration with customer success tools
- **Autonomous Monitoring** - Periodic client activity monitoring
- **Enterprise Communication** - Integration with email and messaging platforms
- **Customer-Facing Agents** - Direct customer engagement capabilities
- **Model Specialization** - Task-specific model optimization
- **RAG Integration** - Enhanced context awareness through retrieval systems

## üöÄ Overview

This system uses a **decision-making agent** with an integrated **evaluator tool(Another agent called as a tool by decision-making agent)** to help Customer Success Managers (CSMs) analyze customer data, assess churn risk, and provide actionable recommendations:

1. **ü§î Decision Making Agent** - Analyzes queries and makes strategic decisions
2. **‚úÖ Evaluator Tool (Agent as a tool) ** - Integrated tool that assesses recommendation quality

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone and setup environment:**
```bash
cd anti_churn_agent
uv sync  # Install dependencies
```

2. **Set environment variables:**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
export BRAVE_API_KEY="your-brave-api-key"  # Optional for web search
```

3. **Run the system:**
```bash
python agent_chat.py          # Main chat interface (Recommended)
# or
python traced_system.py       # Command line
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Chat Interface (Recommended)
```bash
python agent_chat.py
```

This starts the main chat interface where you can:
- Ask questions about customers: `"What's the churn risk for ACME001?"`
- Get recommendations: `"How can I help TECH002 reduce their churn risk?"`
- Access customer data and analysis
- See multi-agent analysis with tracing
- **Monitor tool execution in real-time** - See when tools are being called and their status

### Command Line Interface
```bash
python traced_system.py
```

This runs the traced multi-agent system directly with detailed output.

### Development and Testing
```bash
# Use the existing notebooks for development and testing
jupyter notebook notebooks/brainstorm.ipynb
jupyter notebook notebooks/notebook.ipynb
```

### Example Queries
- `"What's the churn risk for ACME001?"`
- `"How can I help TECH002 reduce their churn risk?"`
- `"What are the key issues with FIN001?"`
- `"Show me high-risk customers"`
- `"What industry trends affect our customers?"`

## ü§ñ Agent Roles

### Decision Making Agent
- **Purpose**: Analyzes customer queries and makes strategic decisions
- **Capabilities**:
  - Understands customer context and problems
  - Determines what data and research is needed
  - Makes decisions based on evidence and best practices
  - Provides clear, actionable recommendations
  - **Strategic Web Search**: Only uses web search for high churn risk clients (>70%)

### Evaluator Tool
- **Purpose**: Integrated tool that assesses recommendation quality
- **Capabilities**:
  - Rates recommendations on a scale of 1-10
  - Assesses feasibility and potential risks
  - Provides feedback for improvement
  - Determines pass/fail status
  - **UI Behavior**: Only shows evaluation results when recommendations FAIL

## üõ†Ô∏è Tool Visibility & Response Timer Features

The system includes comprehensive visibility into tool execution and response timing:

### Tool Visibility Features
- **Real-time Status Display** - Shows current tool being executed in the UI
- **Visual Indicators**:
  - üü¢ **Ready** - System is idle and ready
  - üîÑ **Using [Tool Name]...** - Tool is currently executing
  - ‚úÖ **Completed [Tool Name]** - Tool finished successfully
  - ‚ùå **Error with [Tool Name]** - Tool encountered an error
- **User-specific Tracking** - Each user session maintains independent tool status
- **Manual Refresh** - Refresh button to update tool status
- **Console Logging** - Detailed tool execution logs for debugging

### Response Timer Features
- **Clean Timer Display** - Shows elapsed time without processing indicators
- **Timer States**:
  - ‚è±Ô∏è **Ready** - Initial state
  - ‚úÖ **2.3s** - Shows final completion time
- **Timer Reset** - Clean slate reset functionality
- **CSS Optimization** - Hides Gradio's built-in "processing" text for cleaner display

### How It Works
1. When a user sends a message, the system processes it through the multi-agent framework
2. As tools are called (customer data access, web search, evaluation), the UI shows real-time status
3. Response timer tracks total elapsed time for each interaction
4. Users can see exactly what the agent is doing and how long it takes
5. Each browser session maintains its own tool status and timer independently

### Testing with Multiple Users
- **User A (Chrome)**: Can see their own tool execution status and timer
- **User B (Firefox)**: Has completely separate tool status tracking and timer
- **Independent Sessions**: No interference between different user sessions
