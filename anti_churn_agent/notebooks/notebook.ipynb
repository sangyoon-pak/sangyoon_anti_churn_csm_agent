    "- This is only for demo purpose, hence, a UI-based chat for users to interact. However, in real world, we can consider giving agents a power to autonomously work as an anti-church agent that does periodically monitor each client's activity and data over 1) campaign usage, 2)support ticket(Jira), 3) product adoptions, etc\n",
    "- In real world, Agent can also talk to other tools such as 1)email server, 2) internal communication tools (Slack, MS teams, etc) to notify the right person to engage. \n",
    "- In a more aggressive scenario, we could have the agent face the real customers to engage to prevent churn, but this will require more of a robust agent architecture and workflow. \n",
    "- Purely for the MVP purpose, the model is gpt-4o-mini. However, in real world, we can consider diversifying models that are the right fit for each agentic task in the multi-agent system. \n",
