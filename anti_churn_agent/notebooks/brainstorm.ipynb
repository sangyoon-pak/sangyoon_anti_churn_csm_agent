    "# Anti-Churn Agent MVP - Interactive Chatbot Service\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains prompts and requirements for building an MVP anti-churn agent as an **interactive chatbot service** that CSMs can query on-demand. The AI agent will analyze customer data and provide insights when requested, rather than running autonomously.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Agent Ideas and Capabilities (Interactive Focus)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Function\n",
    "The agent's core function is to **respond to CSM queries** by analyzing customer data and providing actionable insights on-demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Interactive Capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔍 **On-Demand Churn Risk Analysis**\n",
    "- CSM asks: \"What's the churn risk for Customer X?\"\n",
    "- Agent responds with current risk score and key indicators\n",
    "- No continuous monitoring - only when requested\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔎 **Interactive Root Cause Analysis**\n",
    "- CSM asks: \"Why is Customer Y at risk?\"\n",
    "- Agent analyzes recent data and provides detailed explanation\n",
    "- Example response: \"Customer Y has a 75% churn risk due to 60% drop in feature usage over the last 30 days, and 2 negative support tickets in the past week.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 💡 **Contextual Recommendations**\n",
    "CSM asks for specific advice:\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"What should I do about Customer Z?\"**\n",
    "> Agent responds: \"Based on their usage patterns, I recommend scheduling a 15-minute check-in to discuss their recent feature adoption challenges. They've logged in 5 times this week but haven't used the advanced features they purchased.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"How can I help Customer W?\"**\n",
    "> Agent responds: \"Customer W has 3 unresolved support tickets. I suggest prioritizing ticket resolution and offering a personalized onboarding session to address their specific use case.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🌍 **Market Context Queries**\n",
    "- CSM asks: \"What's happening in Customer A's industry?\"\n",
    "- Agent provides relevant market trends and industry insights\n",
    "- Suggests communication strategies based on industry context\n",
    "\n",
